This is a quickstart collections for docker and kubernetes. I am contributing to this as I am learning docker and kubernetes.
The folder contains a basic app related to the name and Dockerfile(s) and docker-compose.yml file(s) used to build image and containers.

The repo will be updated as I discover new things and for popular stacks.
